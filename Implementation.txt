Let us consider a small but busy airport with only one run way. In each unit of
time, one plane can land or one plane can take off, but not both. Planes arrive ready
to land or to take off at random times, so at any given unit of time, the runway may
be idle or a plane may be landing or taking off, and there may be several planes
waiting either to land or take off. We therefore need two queues, called landing
and takeoff, to hold these planes. It is better to keep a plane waiting on the ground
than in the air, so a small airport allows a plane to take off only if there are no
planes waiting to land. Hence, after receiving requests from new planes to land or
take off, our simulation will first service the head of the queue of planes waiting to
land, and only if the landing queue is empty will it allow a plane to take off. We
shall wish to run the simulation through many units of time, and, therefore, we
embed the main action of the program in a loop that runs for cur time (denoting
current time) from 1 to a variable end time. With this notation, we can write an
outline of the main program.
